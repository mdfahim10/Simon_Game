Simon Says Game :

Project Overview :-
Simon Says Game is a browser-based memory game where the player must repeat a sequence of colors generated by the game. With each level, the sequence becomes longer, testing the player’s concentration and memory skills.
The game continues as long as the player correctly follows the pattern. A single mistake ends the game and displays the final score.
What the Project Does
Starts the game when the user presses any key
Displays a random color sequence that grows with each level
Allows the user to click buttons to repeat the sequence
Matches the user’s input with the game’s sequence step-by-step
Ends the game immediately if a wrong button is clicked
Displays the score based on the highest level reached
Resets the game so it can be played again


Tech Stack Used:-
HTML – Used to create the structure of the game interface
CSS – Used for styling, layout, colors, and visual effects like flashing
JavaScript – Used to handle game logic, events, sequence matching, and score management

How to Run the Project:-
Download or clone the project repository to your local system
Make sure all files (index.html, style.css, app.js) are in the same folder
Open the index.html file in any modern web browser
Press any key to start the game
Follow the color sequence shown and try to reach the highest level

Learning Outcome:-
This project helps in understanding:
DOM manipulation
Event handling in JavaScript
Arrays and sequence comparison
Game state management and logic flow
